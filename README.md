# Databases-Project
Tasked to design and develop a system to help manage the quick and efficient delivery of business
products to local companies to support their operations and keep them running as smoothly as possible. The
system should represent one or more product delivery services. Each local supplier should manage a fleet of delivery
vans. Those vans should be used to deliver the products to the businesses as quickly as possible. Businesses should
purchase products from the suppliers. The money paid for the products purchased shoukd flow from the business
owners back to the owner’s delivery service, helping each stay in business.

# Outline of my Approach
• Translated an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram used to chart out the blueprint of the database (EERD) into a comprehensive set of relational schemas,
defining primary keys, unique keys, and foreign keys.

• Developed SQL scripts including CREATE TABLE statements to build database structures and INSERT
statements to populate the database with initial data.

• Implemented twenty-one stored procedures and six dynamic views.

• Engineered a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) featuring a basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) that supports the
functionality of the developed stored procedures and views.
