# Databases-Project
• Translated an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD) into a comprehensive set of relational schemas,
defining primary keys, unique keys, and foreign keys.

• Developed SQL scripts including CREATE TABLE statements to build database structures and INSERT
statements to populate the database with initial data.

• Implemented twenty-one stored procedures and six dynamic views.

• Engineered a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) featuring a basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) that supports the
functionality of the developed stored procedures and views.
